# Spherical
Spherical will be a decentralised social network that will be like Slack. Unlike Slack, however, it will be de-centralised. This means that instead of a centralised social network where Slack holds all the data and therefore can easily be censored/shutdown at the flick of a switch, Spherical will be de-centralised. This means that users can sign up to nodes and then join servers on other nodes (if the node allows for this) where each node will talk to each other about information and eventually relay the information to the user. This means that if a node goes down, only the data on that node has the potential to be lost but even that can be alleviated if other servers have the other node data backup option on. This would mean that the data could be got back for a specific “guild” that users could see from that node.

This should also reduce the risk of country-wide surveillance on users and remove the risk of social network platforms banning users for no reason since each node can have its own set of rules and enforce them in whatever way they please.

Spherical also aims to not expose any user IP addresses to any node other than the node they are connected to (as discussed earlier, nodes will have their IP addresses exposed). This is to make sure that they cannot be tracked easily by anyone other than their connected node.
